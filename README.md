# HaskShell

Currently a VERY basic shell. More of an excercise in Haskell than an actual project, but perhaps I'll come back to this later.

Things to add:

-Reading config files
-Calling from $PATH instead of system sh
-Drop in compatibility with bash
-Piping and other utils (&, ; etc)
-Scripting
-Pretty colors
-Syntax prediction, autocomplete, file navigation
